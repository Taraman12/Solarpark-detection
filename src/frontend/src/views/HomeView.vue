    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    On this website you will find information about my master’s thesis titled “Continues Solar Park
    Detection”. In this project, I used a neural network to continuously detect solar parks from Sentinel-2 data. On the
    website, you can view the results and interactively explore them on a map. You also have the option to validate the
    data.”
